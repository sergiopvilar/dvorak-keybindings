# Dvorak keybindings

A repository to aggregate the necessary setup to program using the Dvorak keyboard layout.

## Editors

### Atom.io

To setup Atom you will need go to `Preferences... > Keybindings` click in the keymap file and paste the content of `keymap.cson` into it. Then go to `Atom menu > Open Your init script` and paste the content of `init.coffe`. After that you must restart Atom.

### Sublime Text

In Sublime Text you will need to go to `Preferences > Key Bindings - User` and paste the content of `Default (OSX).sublime-keymap` into it.

## Operational System support

Currently this repo only supports the Mac OSX platform but we will be glad to add support to others operational systems with your contribution.

### OSX

If you are using OSX you may need a keyboard layout with accents, if so you can downlad the [Dvorak Intertational Keyboard Layout for Mac OSX](http://d.pr/f/17r6O).
